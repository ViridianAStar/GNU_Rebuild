# nGNU - not GNU 
Taking something that works perfectly well and rewritting it in Rust because we think we are special. 


# Goals
A checked box indicates that it is being/has been worked on, doesn't mean it's done. Nothing is ever "done"

## coreutils 

- [x] mkdir
- [x] touch
- [x] ls
- [ ] mv
- [ ] cp
- [ ] todo


 # Why
Why are we even doing this the old question. Well becuase it's fun.... mostly GNU is old and we still like it a lot we just want to moderize some of the core compentents. 
Like mv, cp, touch, mkdir, etc... We also want to add some new functionality to them too, and make them colourful! This project also severs as a way to learn and better our Rust, programming, and co-op skills. 


# How can I help
